		Education cuts under the Conservatives have lead to <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/cash-strapped-schools-beg-parents-10192677" target=_blank><b>schools begging parents for financial support</b> and supplies</a>. According to <a href="http://schoolcuts.org.uk" target=_blank>schoolcuts.org.uk</a> the vast majority of schools face an <b>average cut of £338 per pupil</b>. For infant school children, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/election-2017-conservatives-free-school-breakfast-7p-per-meal-lunch-scrap-education-manifesto-a7752991.html" target=_blank><b>free school lunches will be scrapped</b></a>, to fund a 7p per day breakfast for all school children. The Conservative manifesto promises little to ease these cuts, instead focussing on re-introducing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/grammar-schools-most-teachers-against-new-wave-survey-suggests-a7266451.html" target=_blank>unwanted</a>, and <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/grammar-schools-fail-help-just-about-managing-families-researchers" target=_blank>unsuccessful</a> grammar schools. They also plan to <b>extend the privatised free schools system</b>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/conservative-university-tuition-fees-free-schools-funding-election-2017-education-manifesto-policy-a7743141.html" target=_blank>forcing universities to provide schools</a> paid for from tuition fees. Tuition fees have continued to rise under the Tories, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/11/student-loan-interest-rate-rise-uk-inflation-brexit" target=_blank>to £9,250 per year with interest on loans now reaching 6.1%</a>. It's clear &#8212; <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/youve-clearly-failed-theresa-heckled-10525981" target=_blank><b>the Tories have failed us</b></a>.

		The Labour Party are pledging to introduce a <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/towards-a-national-education-service" target=_blank>National Education Service</a> to provide <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-39934530" target=_blank><b>free education for people of all ages</b></a>. There will be no grammar schools and free schools will be returned to the local education authority. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-free-school-meals-universal-primary-school-children-vat-private-school-fees-a7668811.html" target=_blank>All school children will receive a <b>free school lunch</b></a> and class sizes will be reduced to below 30 children for children between 5 and 7 years old. Cuts to school budgets will be reversed. <b>University education will be free</b> and grants will be re-introduced. The EMA, which provided funding to allow teenagers to stay on at college will also come back, and under a Labour government, <a href="http://feweek.co.uk/2017/05/09/labour-pledge-to-scrap-adult-learner-fees-would-mean-scrapping-fe-loans/" target=_blank>adult learners would be able to re-train for free</a>.
