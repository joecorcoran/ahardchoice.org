		After years of damaging cuts to NHS finding, it's clear the Tories have no plan for the UK's aging population beyond <b>extorting carers</b> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/25/dementia-tax-theresa-may-prime-minister-disabled-people" target=_blank>leaving them homeless after their parents die</a>. The <b>dementia tax</b> proposed by Theresa May is just about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/24/nhs-faces-staggering-increase-in-cost-of-elderly-care-academics-warn-dementia" target=_blank>as <b>cruel</b> a social policy as one can imagine</a>. They've already <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/conservative-poll-lead-cut-half-dementia-tax-u-turn/" target=_blank>started backpedalling</a>, but it's too late â€“ their cards are on the table. As if this wasn't bad enough, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c42f4282-2d90-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a" target=_blank>they're coming for your pension</a> too.

		<a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/social-security" target=_blank>Labour have pledged to <b>keep the "triple lock" on state pensions</b></a>, keeping them at a minimum in line with inflation, and will guarantee the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes as <b>universal benefits</b>. They will also <b>scrap the "bedroom tax"</b> which has forced many older people out of their homes. Labour will also <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/healthcare-for-all" target=_blank>tackle loneliness</a> as a serious and increasing issue in civil society.
