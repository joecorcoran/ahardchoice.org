		Since 2015, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn has had the <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/jeremyforlabour/pages/87/attachments/original/1438076296/WorkingWithWomen.pdf?1438076296" target=_blank>explicit goal</a> of a 50% woman shadow cabinet. <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/a-more-equal-society" target=_blank>Labour</a> will appoint a Violence Against Women Commissioner to oversee central funding for initiatives against domestic and sexual violence, and work to <b>extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland</b>. Labour recognises that there is <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/a-more-equal-society#third" target=_blank>a lot of work to be done for the LGBT community</a>, and will immediately reform the Gender Recognition Act and the Equality Act 2010, for the further <b>protection under law of trans people</b>. They will also work to <b>close the pay gaps</b> suffered by BAME workers by introducing equal pay audits, required by law from all large employers.
