		Tory Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/new-fully-privatised-rail-line-chris-grayling-plans-oxford-cambridge" target=_blank>obsessed with <b>further privatisation</b> of the railways</a>, even facing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-38240094/bob-neill-transport-minister-chris-grayling-should-resign" target=_blank>pressure from other Conservatives to resign</a> after lying about the devolution of London's train services. He's also claimed that <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/cyclists-do-not-count-as-road-users-transport-secretary-chris-grayling-tells-parliament-a3439521.html" target=_blank>cyclists are not real road users</a>. All of this, plus the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tim-fenton/boris-bus-is-a-criminal-w_b_3273424.html" target=_blank><b>wasteful</b></a> Tory transport <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/andrew-neather-the-empty-cable-car-joins-a-string-of-boris-johnson-follies-8713974.html" target=_blank>follies</a> in London, inspires little confidence.

They plan to <b>bring rail travel back into public ownership</b>, at the same time <b>capping fares</b> and protecting transport staff and passengers from the unsafe conditions the Tories have exacerbated. Labour will also focus on expanding transport to the underserved regions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/04/labour-john-mcdonnell-promises-crossrail-for-the-north-to-create-850000-jobs" target=_blank>linking High Speed 2 to a "Crossrail of the North"</a>, as well as upgrading the National Cycle Network.
