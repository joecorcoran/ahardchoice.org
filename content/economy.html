		The Tories have long argued that a programme of austerity was necessary to recover from the financial crash of 2008, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/25/what-is-productivity-why-uk-poor" target=_blank>by every conceivable measure it has been a <b>failure</b></a>. Cuts to public services have left <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9db2d1e8-002a-11e7-8d8e-a5e3738f9ae4" target=_blank>vital institutions <b>unable to function</b></a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8d5297f2-19de-11e7-bcac-6d03d067f81f" target=_blank>productivity has not improved</a>, and <a href="http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2017/02/13/2017-the-year-the-full-effects-of-austerity-are-felt" target=_blank>hundreds of thousands of families are <b>facing the real prospect of homelessness</b></a>.

		<a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/economy" target=_blank>Labour will transform the UK economy through a <b>fairer tax system</b></a>, ensuring that only corporations and the top 5% of earners pay more. Those earning less than £80,000 per year are completely unaffected. Labour will ensure that all of the UK, not just London, receives the <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/economy#fifth" target=_blank><b>investment and upgraded infrastructure</b></a> that is so sorely needed. <b>£250 billion</b> will be spent over the next ten years, reversing the damage that austerity has caused and <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2017/05/labours-investment-bank-plan-could-help-fix-our-damaging-financial-system" target=_blank>encouraging local economies to flourish</a>.
