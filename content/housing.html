		The Tories have promised to build a million homes by 2020 but their record tells a different story – <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/house-building-lowest-level-1920s/" target=_blank><b>house building has fallen to its lowest level</b> since the 1920s</a>. They are planning to build "Fixed term social housing" – social housing which will be sold off after 10-15 years. This is an extension of the right to buy policy which has <a href="http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2015/03/right-to-buy-one-to-one-replacement-falling-short-in-london/" target=_blank>decimated social housing stock</a>. As a result of the bedroom tax, and removing housing benefit for under 21s, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/homelessness-housing-households-shelter-london-england-a7111501.html" target=_blank>the Tories have overseen a <b>huge rise in homelessness</b></a>.

		Labour will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39729595" target=_blank>build 1 million homes, half of which will be available for <b>social rent</b></a> with the remainder available for sale at less than £150,000. Labour also pledges to <b>end rough sleeping</b> by the end of the next parliament, and provide insulation for homes, reducing energy bills and keeping pensioners warm in the winter. <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/secure-homes-for-all" target=_blank>Interest free home improvement loans</a> will be available for home owners to improve the efficiency of their homes. For renters, Labour will bring in 3 year tenancies, giving security and quiet enjoyment to those in rental properties. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/01/labour-housing-pledge-bad-landlords-renters" target=_blank>Minimum standards will be introduced to ensure that homes are <b>fit for habitation</b></a>.
