		Fox hunting was banned in 2005, but the Tories are stuck in the past. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/fox-hunt-masters-secretly-mobilising-10383202" target=_blank>Leaked emails from a Tory peer</a> have revealed their plans to try and overturn the ban, reintroducing a <b>cruel and outdated</b> practice to British society. The Tories have also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/22/why-would-theresa-may-ditch-pledge-ban-ivory-trading" target=_blank>dropped their plans for a ban on ivory trading</a> â€“ clearly prioritising profit over the protection of an endangered species.
