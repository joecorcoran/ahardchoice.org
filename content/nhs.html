With no money left to upgrade the antiquated IT system, <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-cyberattack-ransomware-security" target=_blank>the NHS was recently <b>held to ransom by hackers</b></a>. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/junior-doctors-begin-permanent-protest-outside-department-of-health-a6981871.html" target=_blank>Medical professionals have been forced to strike</a> over unbearable working conditions.
