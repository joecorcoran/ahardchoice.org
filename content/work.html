		In 2015 the Conservatives promised a £9 per hour living wage. They've now <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-living-wage-wont-hit-9990140" target=_blank><b>abandoned this pledge</b>, replacing it with a minumum based on 60% of median earnings</a>. Minimum wage is currently £7.50 per hour for workers over 25. For workers in the gig economy, the Conservative manifesto offers a review of protections, but <b>no policies</b>. The most radical change the Tories can imagine is <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-promise-time-care-sick-10424336" target=_blank>allowing bereaved workers to take unpaid leave</a>, a privilege only the wealthy can afford.

		The Labour manifesto promises a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/10/labour-well-raise-minimum-wage-to-10-an-hour-in-2020" target=_blank><b>£10 per hour real living wage</b> by 2020 for all workers over 18</a>. This is a big boost for young people; the current tiered minimum wage guarantees 18 year olds only £5.25 per hour. Labour will <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/index.php/manifesto2017/fair-deal-at-work" target=_blank><b>outlaw zero hours contracts</b></a>, providing security and guaranteed hours to all workers and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-jeremy-corbyn-john-mcdonnell-policy-end-zero-hours-contracts-unpaid-internships-a7709996.html" target=_blank>banning unpaid internships</a>. All workers will receive full employment rights from day one, employment tribunal fees abolished and paid paternity leave will be doubled to four weeks. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/22/labour-plan-four-new-bank-holidays-for-each-uk-patron-saint" target=_blank><b>Four extra bank holidays</b> will be added to everyone's statutory entitlement</a>, commemorating the patron saints of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
